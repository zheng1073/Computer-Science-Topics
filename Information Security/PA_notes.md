# Fundamental Principles and Concepts

## Integrity and Availability
Integrity:
- unauthorized data alternation
- encrypt data to protect integrity
- unauthorized database rollback or undo

## Security Concepts
Tools:
- Packet filter
  - firewall technique to control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets 
- Packet sniffer
  - used to monitor network traffic
  - examine streams of data packets that flow between computers on a network  
- Stateful firewall
- Asymmetric encryption
  - RSA 
  - public key for encryption and private for decryption 
- Symmetric Cryptography
  - AES 
  - one key for both encryption and decryption
- Block Cipher
  - way of encrypting data in blocks to produce ciphertext using a crytographic key and algorithm 
- Honeypot
  - security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems
  -  controlled and safe environment for showing how attackers work and examining different types of threats
- Hash Functions
- Fuzzer
  - automated software testing technique that attempts to find hackable software bugs by randomly feeding invalid and unexpected inputs and data into a computer program in order to find coding errors and security loopholes 

Attacks:
- SQL Injection 
  - server-side web attack

OOP organizes the program to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an "Object".

**Objects**: basic building blocks of OOP. For example, a Online Shopping System will have the followig objects: shopping cart, customer, product item ...

**Class**: blueprint of an object

### Principles of object-oriended programming
1. **Encapsulation**:
  - Binding data together to hide it from the outside world
  - Objects keep its state private so other objects don't have direct access to its state
  - They can only be reached through a set of public functions
2. **Abstraction**:
  - Hide all but the relevant data about an object to reduce the complexity of the system
  - Hide internal implementation details of objects and only revealing operations that are relevant to other objects
3. **Inheritance**:
  - Create new classes from existing ones
4. **Polymorphism**:
  - Ability of object to take different forms to respond to the same message in different ways. 
  - Example: In a chess game, a chess piece can take many forms (bishop, castle, knight) and all these pieces will respond differently to the "move" message

## Quality Best Practices
### Development Process Improvements
Test plans:
- Migration
- Master
- Maintenance
- Mitigation - face and resolve the risks of the development process

Functional Ssytem Testing - testing the end-to-end functionality of the system as a whole

Formal Coding Review Process - the programmer narrates, statement by statement, the logic of the program
- code inspection

Test:
- description of the correct output for a set of input data
- validates the input conditions that produce defined requirements

Verification Steps:
- compare input of system design phase to the input of the program design phase

Types of reviews:
- technical - identify descrepancies from specificiations or standards
- circulation - geographically separated and teleconferencing is impossible
- peer

### Testing Best Practices
Quality methods:
- code inspection - programmer narrates, statement by statement, the logic of a program as an error detection technique
- black box testing
  - verify the usability of a product as it is being delivered to ensure overall design and functionality without regard to the internal functioning of the code. 
  - post informal review  and the development team has to evaluate the module from an end user perspective. 
  - aid in deriving test data based on analysis of the requirements specifications
- white box testing
- peer reviews

Types of reviews:
- walkthrough
- informal
- inspection
  - need a moderator to review 
- end user

Types of test:
- integration
  - system design phase 
- module
- system
- acceptance
  - requirements phase 
- regression 
  - implementation phase
  - change part of the project that has already been written and tested 

### Bug Management Best Practices
!! Document each issue with details in a bug report

### Debugging Best Practices
practices:
- backtracking
- induction
- deduction
- error analysis
- brute force

### A Simple VIew of the CMMI
On a high-level view, CMMI is project management, quality management, and engineering all glued together by process management. 

### Process and Business
Processes that define how a business does business:
- Software engineering processes
- Hardware engineering processes
- Systems engineering processes
- Manufacturing processes
- Financial processes
- Human resource processes
- Legal processes

Build the product right --> meet the requirements

Build the right product --> meet the client's needs in the intended environment

### Are Process Descriptions Enough? 
1. Does your organization have process descriptions at the project and/ororganizational level?
2. Does your organization provide training on the processes the project andsupport groups are supposed to follow?
3. Does your organization perform objective evaluations to ensure theprocesses that are defined and trained are being adhered too?
4. Does it work?

### Other Groupings of Process Areas to Support Process Improvement
Process improvement is linked primarily to 2 categorizations:
1. Staged Representation
  - divided into levels/stages
  - Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, Optimizing
2. Continuous Representation
  - divided into modules/different concepts 
  - Process Management Concepts, Project Management Concepts, ENgineering Concepts, Support Concepts

Other categorizations:
- Project Management Oriented Categorization
  - Requirements Concepts
  - Project Management Concepts
  - Process Management Concepts
  - Engineering Concepts
  - Integrated Teaming Concepts
  - Quantitative Management Concepts
  - Optimizing Concepts 
- Practical Use Categorization
  - Project Management Concepts
  - Quality Management Concepts
  - Engineering Concepts
  - Acquisition Concepts
  - Process Management Concepts
  - Integrated Teaming Concepts
  - Quantitative Management Concepts

### Sticky Areas
Project Management:
- Size and complexity estimation
- Having "historical data" to support the estimation
- Estimations based on "hours" is not size estimation
- Importance of WBS for PM and Supplier Management
- Staeholders include both interal and external groups
Configuration Management
- Status Accounting
- Configuration Auditing
Quality Assurance
- Project quality plan does not contain the details of quality audits, configuration management, testing, peer reviews
- Quality assurance plan is seperate from the project quality plan
- Quality control is exemplified by peer reviews and testings while quality assurance focuses on process and product compliance

### Entry Strategies into Process Improvement
!!! When starting a process improvement initiatve, it is important to determine the appropriate tasking and the scope of the process improvement program.

The process improvement entry strategy depends on several factors such as:
- history of previous process improvement programs or quality improvement programs
- financial and human resources
- software engineering capability
- technology support
- scope and contractual obligations
- standards
- business and measurement objectives

### Quick Check
Quick Check can provide an understanding of the principles of process improvment and devleop a gestalt of what the management and practitioners think are their most pressing problems.

Day 1: reviw concepts of process improvement. Topics include:
- Process improvement mode
- process management concepts
- assessment principles and general flow
- guidance for action planning
- action planning
- managing process change
- process improvement infrastructure

Day 2:series of interviews to help brainstorm

### Focused Process Area Accessment
- Process Capability --> Process Area strengths
- Findings --> weakness or process problems
- Consequences --> risk associated with the findings
- Recommendations --> how the process problems might be solved 

Guidance for Action Planning (GAP) --> outputs indicate to senior management what support must be provided to get action going in the particular PA

## The Integration Strategy 
Need integration sequence, environment for performing the integration and the development and use of integration procedures

### The Integration Environment
- enviornment may incldue test equipment, simulators, pieces of real equipment, and recording devices

### Product Integration Procedures
- include guidance on the number of planned iterations and expected test results for each iteration 

### Readiness for Integration: Interface Requirements
- Make sure all product components are compliant with their interface requirements
- Interfaces are classified into 3 main classes:
  - environmental
  - physical
  - functional 
- Categories for these classes include:
  - mechanical
  - fluid
  - sound
  - electrical
  - climate
  - electromagnetic
  - thermal
  - message interfaces
  - human-machine or human interface 

### Assembly of Product Components
- process of integration can continue once the readiness criteria is met

### Evaluation of Assembled Product Components

### Verification
- also includes verification of intermediate work products against requirements 
- verification method address the technical approach to work product verification and the specific actions, resources, and environments
- System verification incldues functional, physical, interface verification
  - Functional --> system performance testing and qualification testing

**Systems Testing VS Bench Testing**
- system testing --> measuring a product component's performance while installed in a real or reasonable approximation of a functional system
- bench testing --> insertion of a product component into a test loop where all of the variables can be independently controlled, measured and recorded

### Validation
- make sure the completed and intefrated system will operate as needed in the environment it was intended

### Acceptance Testing
- final verification and validation criteria
- confrim the product is ready for operational use

### Packaging and Delivery
-

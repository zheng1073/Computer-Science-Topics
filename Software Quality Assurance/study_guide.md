## Testing Strategy 
**White Box**
- logic based
- exhaustive testing doesn't meal programs match the requirements/specs
- Types:
  - Statement
  - Decision
  - Condition
  - Multiple-Decision
  - Decision/Condition


**Black Box**
- Goal is to be completely unconcerned about internal workings of the program.
- Exhaustive Input Testing: make use of every possible input condition as a test case.
- Types:
  - Equivalence Partitioning
    - sub-setting, does not explore combinations 
  - Boundary Analysis
    - higher payoff, does not explore combinations 
  - Cause-Effect Graphinh
    - formal language into which a natural-language specification is translated
    - the graph is a digitial logic circuit (combinatorial logic netwrok) 
  - Error Guessing 


**Grey Box**

**Code Inspections**
- code-oriented: error identification


**Walkthroughs**
- code-oriented 


**Peer Ratings**
- Technique of evaluating anonymous programs in terms of their overall quality, maintainability, extensibility, usability, and clarity. 
- The purpose of the technique is to provide programmer self-evaluation.


## Program Testing Guidelines
- Important part of a test case --> definition of the expected output
- programmer should avoid testing his/her own program
- testing protocol should include a thorough inspection of the results of each test
- test cases written for input conditions that are invalid, valid, unexpected, and expected
- examine a program to see if it does NOT do what it is supposed to AND

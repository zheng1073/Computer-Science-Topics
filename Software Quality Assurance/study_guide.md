## Testing Strategy 
**White Box**
- logic based
- exhaustive testing doesn't meal programs match the requirements/specs
- Types:
  - Statement
  - Decision
  - Condition
  - Multiple-Decision
  - Decision/Condition
**Black Box**
- Goal is to be completely unconcerned about internal workings of the program.
- Exhaustive Input Testing: make use of every possible input condition as a test case.
- Types:
  - Equivalence Partitioning
  - Boundary Analysis
  - Cause-Effect Graphinh
  - Error Guessing 
**Grey Box**

**Code Inspections**
- code-oriented: error identification
**Walkthroughs**
- code-oriented 
**Peer Ratings**
-Technique of evaluating anonymous programs in terms of their overall quality, maintainability, extensibility, usability, and clarity. 
The purpose of the technique is to provide programmer self-evaluation.

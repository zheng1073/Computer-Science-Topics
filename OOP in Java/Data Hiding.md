Data hiding refers to the concept of hiding the inner workings of a class and simply providing an interface through which the outside world can interact with the class without knowing whatâ€™s going on inside. This wayy instances of these classes should not be able to cause any unauthorized access or change in the original contents of a class.

Data hiding can be divided into two primary components:
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation in OOP refers to binding the data and the methods to manipulate that data together in a single unit (class).

If we declare all the data members or instance variables of a class private, direct access from the code outisde that class will be restricted. A public method will be needed to let the outside world communicate with the private fields.

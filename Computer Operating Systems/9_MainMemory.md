### Background
- For a program to run, it must be brought from the disk into memory and placed within a process.
- Main memory and registers are the only storage that CPU's can access directly.
- main memory can take many cycles --> causing a stall ; register access is one CPU clock or less
- Cache is between main memory and CPU registers
- protection of memory required to ensure correct operation
